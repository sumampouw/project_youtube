## The objectives

This project aims to perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice what I have learned so far using API, BI tool, statistical and EDA techniques.

### The outcomes in this project:

The result uses analyzing the data using exploratory data analysis (EDA), summarizing the dataset's statistical aspects, and providing insights. Further on, show results using friendly user data visualization.

We will try to understand YouTube patterns better and find out how YouTubers make money posting videos. We will be doing some exploratory data analysis on the tops videos worldwide. Then we will narrow a bit to only Germany as a country, extracting whatever insights we can get and answering some common questions. We all know what YouTube is, hence the platform is saturated. Almost everyone is a YouTuber or at least tries to take advantage of it for a bit of income. These people who struggle to get viewers onto their videos need to understand what is trending and take advantage of it because, in YouTube, more views equal more money.

Common questions that any content owner needs to answer such as:
- Which video category attracts more views?
- What's the most frequent type of video?
- Who are the most frequent audience?
- Which countries have the most viewers?
- What kind of video title attracts more views?
- How to optimize video tags to attract more views?

The analysis has successfully answered the common questions and has provided an insight into the data; we can go deeper into our research and create more hypotheses to answer more questions. In the end, information is everything; hence, you can get that Youtube Money by following several steps of instructions on your Youtube Journey, and you'll probably be set for life. :wink:
